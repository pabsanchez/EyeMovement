# Eye Movement

## :white_medium_square: Description
### Week 8 Final Exercise
### This exercise is called Eye Movement, like it's name says it consists on the movement of the eyes located at the center of the screen following the movement of your cursor.


## :white_medium_square: How to run
### Once you load the page on your browser, move your cursor around the screen and watch how the eyes observe everything you do! 

## :white_medium_square: Roadmap of future improvements
### In the future i would like to add the change of color of the eyes to red, like they were furious if you click over them.
